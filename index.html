            Hello, my name is Samantha and I am a UX/UI designer living in Minneapolis. 
            I have 10 years of experience as a graphic designer, working for B2B and B2C national companies. 
            Before moving to Minneapolis, I worked with the in-house creative team for a fortune 500 company headquartered in Seattle. 
            I received my BFA in graphic design from Montana State University. I am inspired by simple and thoughtful design, I have a natural explorer personality and am passionate about expanding my creative skillset.
